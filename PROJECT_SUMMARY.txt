ADAPTIVE FEATURE IMPORTANCE REWEIGHTING FOR CREDIT RISK
================================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
----------------
Production-quality ML project implementing adaptive feature importance 
reweighting for credit default prediction. Combines gradient-based feature 
attribution with temporal curriculum learning.

NOVEL CONTRIBUTION
------------------
- Adaptive loss weighting mechanism that rebalances feature importance based 
  on per-epoch SHAP value distributions
- Temporal curriculum learning for progressive sample difficulty scaling
- Risk segment stratification for targeted reweighting

KEY FEATURES
------------
✓ Ensemble of LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost models
✓ Adaptive feature importance reweighting (SHAP, permutation, gradient-based)
✓ Curriculum learning scheduler with multiple schedules
✓ Comprehensive evaluation metrics (ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, KS statistic, Gini)
✓ Full training pipeline with early stopping and checkpointing
✓ MLflow integration for experiment tracking
✓ Production-ready prediction script
✓ Extensive test suite (>70% coverage target)

QUICK START
-----------
1. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Train the model:
   python scripts/train.py --config configs/default.yaml

3. Evaluate on test set:
   python scripts/evaluate.py --checkpoint models/best_model.pkl

4. Make predictions:
   python scripts/predict.py --checkpoint models/best_model.pkl --input data/sample.csv

ABLATION STUDY
--------------
Compare baseline vs. full model:

# Baseline (no adaptive reweighting)
python scripts/train.py --config configs/ablation.yaml

# Full model (with adaptive reweighting)
python scripts/train.py --config configs/default.yaml

TESTING
-------
Run test suite:
pytest tests/ -v --cov=src --cov-report=html
